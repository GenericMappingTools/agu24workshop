1Ô∏è‚É£. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to GMT 6.0, ambitious movie makers had to write complicated scripts where the advancement of frames was explicitly done by a shell loop.
At the end of the script, you would have to convert your PostScript plot to a raster image with a name that is lexically increasing,
and then later you would use some external software to assemble the movie. Hence, only very brave GMT users attempted to make GMT animations.
Here you can see a `more complete explanation <https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/5.4/gallery/anim_introduction.html>`_
and `some examples <https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/5.4/Gallery.html#animations>`_ of those times.

GMT 6 (`Wessel et al. 2019 <https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GC008515>`_) simplified all that by adding movie-making modules
that were later refined with GMT 6.5 (`Wessel et al. 2024 <https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GC011545>`_).
These modules empower users to create animations by taking over non-trivial tasks.


1.1. What is an Animation?
==========================

- Animation is a technique used to create the illusion of motion.
- This is achieved by displaying a rapid sequence of still images (at least 12 frames per second; fps).


1.2. How to Make an Animation
=============================

In order to make an animation we need:

#. A series of still images.
#. A method to combine these images into a video format.

.. admonition:: Technical Information

  A video file is essentially a container format that sequentially displays all the images it contains.


1.3. Why use GMT for animations?
================================

GMT is ideal for animations that require:

- Scientific precision.
- Handling geospatial data.
- High-quality graphical visualizations.

1.4. Types of animations in GMT
================================

For the purposes of this tutorial, I define two types of animations that can be made based on their complexity:

#. **Moving object** (e.g., Earth spinning), created using the :gmt-module:`movie` module.
#. **Appearing object** (e.g., earthquakes), created using both the :gmt-module:`movie` and :gmt-module:`events` modules.


1.5. Prerequisites
==================

- GMT version 6.5 or later.
- Bash scripting environment: The examples in this tutorial are written in Bash and may not work correctly in other shell environments (e.g., zsh, fish, or Windows cmd).


2Ô∏è‚É£. Tutorial 1. Earth spinning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here I explain how to make an animation of a moving object which only requires the :gmt-module:`movie` module.

As an example, I will create an animation of the Earth spinning like the one below.

..  youtube:: uZtyTv6DLnM
    :align: center
    :height: 400px
    :aspect: 1:1


.. admonition:: Technical Information

  This animation was created using 360 images (or frames), with each frame representing a 1-degree rotation in the central longitude of the map,
  displayed at 24 fps.


To create the animation, I follow these four steps:

#. Make first image
#. Make master frame with gmt movie
#. Make draft animation
#. Make full animation


2.1. Goals of the Tutorial
==========================

- Explain the most important aspects of using the :gmt-module:`movie` module which include:

  - What is :gmt-module:`movie`
  - How to set the Canvas (-C)
  - What are and how to use the movie parameters
  - How to set the number of Frames (-T)


2.2. Make first image
======================

The first step is to create an image using a standard GMT script
(with `modern mode <https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.5/reference/introduction.html#modern-and-classic-mode>`_)
that will serve as the base for the animation.

.. Important::

  **Step Goal**: Create the first image of the animation.

For this example, I create a map of the Earth with:

     .. gmtplot::
        :height: 400 px

        gmt begin Earth png
            # Plot relief grid
            gmt grdimage @earth_relief_06m -I -JG0/0/13c
        gmt end


.. admonition:: Technical Information

  - **gmt begin; gmt end**: Commands to start and end a GMT script using modern syntax.
  - **@earth_relief_06m**: A remote grid of Earth's relief with a 6-minute resolution.
  - **-I**: Apply illumination to the grid.
  - **-JG0/0/13c**: Perspective projection with the center at longitude 0 and latitude 0, with a 13 cm map width.


2.3. Make the Master Frame
===========================

In this second step, I recreate the previous image but with the :gmt-module:`movie` module which is used to create animations.


.. Important::

  **Step Goal**: Make a master frame that looks identical to the first image.

2.3.1. What is GMT movie?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :gmt-module:`movie` module simplifies most of the steps needed to create an animation
by executing a single plot script that is repeated across all frames.

**Required Arguments:**

- **mainscript**: Script that will be used to create all the frames.
- **-N**: Name for the output file.
- **-C**: Canvas Size (see below).
- **-T**: Number of frames (see below).
- There are two types of outputs. An image (called *master frame*; **-M**) or a video (**-F**). You have to ask for at least one of them.

**Optional Arguments** (useful for this tutorial):

- **-G**: Set the canvas color (or fill).
- **-V**: Show verbose information during the movie-making process.
- **-L**: Show a label with the frame number.

2.3.2. First Attempt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the first attempt, I create the first frame (``-M0,png``) over a black canvas (``-Gblack``) for an HD video format (``-Chd``).

     .. gmtplot::
        :height: 400 px

        cat << 'EOF' > main.sh
        gmt begin
          gmt grdimage @earth_relief_06m -I -JG0/0/13c
        gmt end
        EOF
        gmt movie main.sh -NEarth -Chd -T360 -M0,png -V -L+f14p,Helvetica-Bold,white -Gblack


.. Error::

  - The figure does not fit on the canvas!
  - There is excess space on one side.


.. admonition:: Technical Information

  - The previous script is enclosed between ``cat << 'EOF' > main.sh`` and ``EOF``.
  - This creates the ``main.sh`` file on-the-fly (using a `Here Document <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document>`_).
  - This is useful because it allows us to see (and edit) the main script and the arguments of :gmt-module:`movie` just using a single file.


2.3.3. The Canvas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**What is the Canvas?**

- The canvas is the black area of the previous image.
- This is the working area of the frames.
- The elements of the main script must be drawn inside the canvas.
- The elements that are outside will be (totally or partially) hidden in the animation.
- The canvas size is important by two reasons:

  - to set the width and height (in cm or inches) of the frames.
  - to set the dimensions in pixels of the frames/movie (i.e. the quality).


**How to set the canvas**:

- This is set via ``movie -C``.
- There are two ways to the set the canvas:

  - Preset formats
  - Custom format

**Preset formats**:

- It is the easiest way to specify the canvas.
- Use the name (or alias) to select a format based on this table (for 16:9 format):

 ======================= ================== =========
  Preset format (alias)   Pixel dimensions   DPC
 ======================= ================== =========
  4320p (8k and uhd-2)    7680 x 4320       320
  2160p (4k and uhd)      3840 x 2160       160
  1080p (fhd and hd)      1920 x 1080       80
  720p                    1280 x 720        53.3333
  540p                    960 x 540         40
  480p                    854 x 480         35.5833
  360p                    640 x 360         26.6667
  240p                    426 x 240         17.75
 ======================= ================== =========

- Pixel density (dots-per-cm, dpc) is set automatically.
- For the 16:9 format, the canvas is 24 x 13.5 cm:


     .. gmtplot::
        :height: 400 px
        :align: center
        :show-code: FALSE

        gmt begin Canvas png
          gmt basemap -Jx0.5c -R0/24/0/13.5 -B+glightgreen+t"16x9 format" --FONT_TITLE=24,Helvetica
          gmt basemap -Ba5f1g5+u" cm" -BWeSn
	        echo 24 cm by 13.5 cm | gmt text -F+f24p+cMC -Gwhite
        gmt end


.. Important::

  - By default, the canvas has an offset of 2.54 cm (or 1 inch) in X and Y.

.. Note::

   - You can also specify the dimensions in inches (or points).
   - There are also preset formats for 4:3 (uxga, sxga+, xga, svga, dvd).


**Custom format**:

- If you want another dimension, you can request a custom format directly by giving width and height and dpu (*widthxheightxdpu*).


.. Important::

  - DPU: Dots-per-unit pixel density. So, it is DPI for inches or DPC for centimeters.


2.3.4. Second attempt. Fix the canvas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this new attempt I:

  - use a custom canvas of a square of 13 cm and 80 dpc (same resolution as full hd, ``-C13cx13cx80``).
  - use ``-X0`` and ``-Y0`` (in ``main.sh``) to remove the default offset.


     .. gmtplot::
        :height: 400 px

        cat << 'EOF' > main.sh
        gmt begin
          gmt grdimage @earth_relief_06m -I -JG0/0/13c -X0 -Y0
        gmt end
        EOF
        gmt movie main.sh -NEarth -C13cx13cx80 -T360 -M0,png -V -L+f14p,Helvetica-Bold,white -Gblack


2.4. Make draft animation
=========================

Once the master frame is ok, I recommend making a very short and small movie so you don't have to wait very long to see the result.

.. admonition:: **Step Goals**:

  - See that the video file is created properly.
  - See that the frames are changing as expected.


.. Note::

  The conversion to a video format relies on `FFmpeg <https://www.ffmpeg.org/>`_ (for MP4 or WebM)
  and `GraphicsMagick <http://www.graphicsmagick.org/>`_ (for GIF).


2.4.1. First attempt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this step I reduce the number of frames to 10 (``-T10``) and the quality to 30 DPC (``-C13cx13cx30``).
Also, I add the following arguments to :gmt-module:`movie`:

- **-Fmp4**: to create a mp4 video (now it is possible to delete ``-M``).
- **-Zs**: to remove the temporary files created in the movie-making process. Useful to keep the working directory clean.


    .. code-block:: bash

        cat << 'EOF' > main.sh
        gmt begin
          gmt grdimage @earth_relief_06m -I -JG0/0/13c -X0 -Y0
        gmt end
        EOF
        gmt movie main.sh -NEarth -C13cx13cx30 -T10 -M0,png -V -Gblack -L+f14p,Helvetica-Bold,white -Fmp4 -Zs


  ..  youtube:: hHmXSYpV0yw
    :align: center
    :height: 400px
    :aspect: 1:1

.. Note::

  The display frame rate is set by default to 24 `fps <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate>`_. It can be change with `-D <https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.5/movie.html#d>`_.


.. Error::

  - The movie doesn't change. We must learn about parameters.

2.4.2. Movie Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The movie parameters are key to making animations.
They are automatically assigned by different movie arguments (see tables below).
There are two sets of parameters:

.. The key idea in :gmt-module:`movie` is for the user to write the main script that makes the idea of the animation and it is used for all frames.

**Variable parameters**:

- These values change with the frame number.
- They must be used in the *main script* to introduce variations in the frames.


 ============== ============================================= ===============
  Parameter                  Purpose or contents               Set by Movie
 ============== ============================================= ===============
  MOVIE_FRAME    Number of current frame being processed       -T
  MOVIE_TAG      Formatted frame number (string)               -T
  MOVIE_NAME     Prefix for current frame image                -N and -T
  MOVIE_COLk     Variable k from data column k, current row    -T\ *timefile*
  MOVIE_TEXT     The full trailing text for current row        -T\ *timefile*
  MOVIE_WORDw    Word w from trailing text, current row        -T\ *timefile*
 ============== ============================================= ===============


**Constant parameters**:

- These values do NOT change during the whole movie.
- They can be used in the *main script* (and in the optional background and foreground scripts).


 ============== ================================================= =====================
  Parameter               Purpose or contents                      Set by Movie
 ============== ================================================= =====================
  MOVIE_NFRAMES   Total number of frames in the movie               -T
  MOVIE_WIDTH     Width of the movie canvas                         -C
  MOVIE_HEIGHT    Height of the movie canvas                        -C
  MOVIE_DPU       Dots (pixels) per unit used to convert to image   -C
  MOVIE_RATE      Number of frames displayed per second             -D
 ============== ================================================= =====================

.. Important::

    - In order to introduce changes in the frames we must use the **variable parameters**.

2.4.3. How to set the number of Frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of frames (``-T``) is another important aspect to make animations.
There are 3 ways to do it:


1. **-TNumber**:

If you supply a single (integer) value, then it will be the total number of frames.
Under the hood, this will create a one-column data set from 0 to that number minus one.
For example, for ``-T10`` I get values from 0 to 9.
In the main script, you have to use the MOVIE_FRAME parameter to access the values.


2. **-Tmin/max/inc**:

If you supply 3 values, then GMT will create a one-column data set from *min* to *max*, incrementing by *inc*.
You have to use the MOVIE_COL0 parameter to access the values of the one-column data set.
The total of number of frames will be:

.. math::

     \text{total frames} = \frac{\text{max} - \text{min}}{\text{inc}} + 1


3. **-Ttimefile**:

If you supply the name of a file, then GMT will access it and use one record (i.e. row) per frame.
This method allows you to have more than one-column and can be used to make more complex animations.
For example, you can have a second column with numbers that you can access using MOVIE_COL1.
The file can even have trailing text that will be accessed with MOVIE_TEXT.


2.4.4. Second attempt. Use parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now I update the script with movie parameters.
First, I use the ``MOVIE_FRAME`` variable parameter to set the central longitude of the map.
I also use the ``MOVIE_WIDTH`` constant parameter (in ``main.sh``) to set the width of the map (instead of 13c).


      .. code-block:: bash

        cat << 'EOF' > main.sh
        gmt begin
         gmt grdimage @earth_relief_06m -I -JG-${MOVIE_FRAME}/0/${MOVIE_WIDTH} -Y0 -X0
        gmt end
        EOF
        gmt movie main.sh -NEarth -C13cx13cx30 -T10 -M0,png -V -Gblack -L+f14p,Helvetica-Bold,white -Fmp4 -Zs

.. Note::

  I add a minus sign so the earth spins in the correct sense.


..  youtube:: sagKzhI88tU
    :align: center
    :height: 400px
    :aspect: 1:1


2.5. Make full animation
========================

Once the draft animation is working it is possible to increment the number of frames (-T) and movie quality (-C).

In the step, I increase:

- the number of frames to 360 (``-T360``) to get the whole spin.
- the resolution to 80 DPC (``-C13cx13cx80``) to get a high-quality video.

    .. code-block:: bash

        cat << 'EOF' > main.sh
        gmt begin
         gmt grdimage @earth_relief_06m -I -JG-${MOVIE_FRAME}/0/13c -X0 -Y0
        gmt end
        EOF
        gmt movie main.sh -NEarth -C13cx13cx80 -T360 -M0,png -V -Gblack -L+f14p,Helvetica-Bold,white -Fmp4 -Zs

..  youtube:: uZtyTv6DLnM
    :align: center
    :height: 400px
    :aspect: 1:1

.. Tip::

  Be careful. This step can be quite time (and resource) consuming.
  By default, :gmt-module:`movie` uses all the cores available to speed up the frame creation process.
  So probably you can't do anything else while GMT is creating all the frames (maybe you can take a break, or have lunch).
  Also you could use `-x <https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.5/gmt.html#core-full>`_ to specify the number of active cores to be used.


3Ô∏è‚É£. Tutorial 2. Earthquakes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the extended section to see the tutorial 2 about appearing objects.
That type of animation is more complex and requires the use :gmt-module:`events` and :gmt-module:`movie` modules.
In that tutorial, I create an animation showing the occurrences of earthquakes during the year 2018 (with one frame per day).
